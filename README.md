# Snake game

This branch is first version of the game which is a copy of code from [Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs) by Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo - and it's just here for reference.

2nd version is the same Javascript code but pushed to be as pure as possible [Link here](https://github.com/HedonSoftware/snake/tree/2-fp-version).

3rd version based on Elixir with Phoenix LiveView to be pushed in soon.
